# automata-illustration
Theory of Computation, a significant subject in Computer Science. Here you can find illustration algorithms for the data in this subject.


ways to ocontribute:

I'm looking to expand my project in these ways:
1. enhancing user experience
2. implementing better visualization for automata using matplotlib
3. adding a whole new feature: translating given automata illustration into python dictionary. (needs CV, API is also approved)

most importantly, I'm looking forward to find parts in my code that are not the best way written. if you found any, please let me know.
